-- Creating: This part of the challenge asked users to create a database and insert data into the table named 'shirts'.

CREATE DATABASE shirts_db;
 
USE shirts_db;
 
CREATE TABLE shirts (
    shirt_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    article VARCHAR(50),
    color VARCHAR(50),
    shirt_size VARCHAR(5),
    last_worn INT
);
 
DESC shirts;
 
INSERT INTO shirts (article, color, shirt_size, last_worn)  
VALUES 
	('t-shirt', 'white', 'S', 10),
	('t-shirt', 'green', 'S', 200),
	('polo shirt', 'black', 'M', 10),
	('tank top', 'blue', 'S', 50),
	('t-shirt', 'pink', 'S', 0),
	('polo shirt', 'red', 'M', 5),
	('tank top', 'white', 'S', 200),
	('tank top', 'blue', 'M', 15);
 
INSERT INTO shirts (article, color, shirt_size, last_worn)
VALUES ('polo shirt','purple', 'M', 50);




-- Reading: This part of the challenge asked users to read portions of the table once they were created 
-- via the use of SELECT statements.

SELECT article, color FROM shirts;
 
SELECT * FROM shirts WHERE shirt_size='M';
 
SELECT article, color, shirt_size, last_worn FROM shirts WHERE shirt_size='M';



-- Update: This part of the challenge asked users to update portions of the table we had created.

UPDATE shirts 
SET 
    shirt_size = 'L'
WHERE
    article = 'polo shirt';
    
    
UPDATE shirts 
SET 
    last_worn = 0
WHERE
    last_worn = 15;
    
    
UPDATE shirts 
SET 
    color = 'off white',
    shirt_size = 'XS'
WHERE
    color = 'white';



-- Delete: This portion of the challenge asked users to delete the work they had just created for the challenge. 

SELECT * FROM shirts WHERE last_worn=200;
 
DELETE FROM shirts WHERE last_worn=200;
 
 
SELECT * FROM shirts WHERE article='tank top';
 
DELETE FROM shirts WHERE article='tank top';
